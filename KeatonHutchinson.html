    <h2> A little bit about me...</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Keaton Hutchinson, and I was born in Savannah, Georgia on August 5th, 2003.  </p>
    <p>I moved to New Brighton, PA when I was only 1. I went to New Brighton highschool and got my </p>
    <p>diploma. This led to me finding a local Univerity, Slippery Rock, to major in Pre-pharmacy. </p>
    <p>I worked in a pharmacy back home, and this is why I choose that major. I ended up getting to</p>
    <p>my second year of schooling when I realized I would be miserable if I kept up with this career.</p>
    <p>Rather than be stuck, I gathered the confidence to confide in myself to choose a new path for</p>
    <p>the future. This is when I thought about a video game programming class I took in highschool.</p>
    <p>I realized I throughly enjoyed working with computers and enjoyed writing the code to see the</p>
    <p>end results. I made my switch to Computing: Information Technology Systems and haven't looked</p>
    <p>looked past since! Within my first semester, my interest on what I could do with this new found</p>
    <p>love for programming grew astronomically! I am glad I made the switch to my new major and cannot</p>
    <p>wait to work within software development, IOS app development, Webdesign, and so much more!</p>
